# Music Store Data Analysis (SQL Project)

## Introduction
The Music Store Data Analysis project provides an opportunity to apply SQL concepts to a real-world dataset.  
By working with a music store database, you will practice creating tables, defining relationships, importing data, and writing queries to answer business questions.

## Learning Objectives
- Design and implement a relational database schema with appropriate constraints.
- Import and validate data from CSV files.
- Write SQL queries to extract and analyze data.
- Apply advanced SQL techniques such as joins, aggregations, and subqueries.

## Project Setup
1. Create a database named `music_store`.
2. Run the schema file (`music_store_schema.sql`) to set up all tables.
3. Import the provided CSV datasets into the tables.

## Schema
Tables include:
- Genre, MediaType, Employee, Customer, Artist, Album, Track, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Playlist, PlaylistTrack

## Tasks
1. Who is the senior most employee based on job title?  
2. Which countries have the most invoices?  
3. What are the top 3 values of total invoice?  
4. Which city has the best customers?  
5. Who is the best customer?  
6. Rock music listeners by email, name & genre.  
7. Top 10 artists who wrote most Rock music.  
8. Tracks longer than average length.  
9. Total spent by each customer on artists.  
10. Most popular genre per country.  
11. Top customer per country and spend.  

## Deliverables
- SQL Schema (`music_store_schema.sql`)
- SQL Queries (`queries.sql`)
- Project Presentation (PPT)
